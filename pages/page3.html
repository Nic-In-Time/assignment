                        Integrated circuits allow us to package up and abstract away individual circuits (transistors, cables, resistors, etc.). They are made using
                        photolithography, where masks (shadows) and powerful lights etch/burn a circuit patern into chips.

                        <p>Using the table below, find the largest number that the decimal number fits into. Mark down a 1 in that position, and if it does not fit, 
                            put down a 0. Repeat until you finish the number. To go from binary to decimal, use the same table and add up all the positions that have a
                            1's values to get the number.
