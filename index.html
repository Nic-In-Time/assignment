                    <p>Search Engines take in keywords, and give you webpages that have those keywords. 
                        The pages are ordered using several factors, including how often it is visited, among other factors.</p>

                    <h2>LLMs</h2>
                    <p>The LLMs start by tokenizing words. This means that the words are turned into numbers that 
                        represent them. The numbers are a vector, representing the location of the word. This is used to 
                        predict the next word, that next word being the one closest to them without having transformers. These
                        vectors also take into account the words before the one that is getting tokenized, making LLMs 
                        different from a basic prediction in, say, an SMS app. The vectors are not just 2d, or even 3d, 
                        but can stretch hundreds of dimentions. Transformers are used to add into the equation previous 
                        wordsin the sentence.
